# Voice-Controlled-Assistant
Description:
Implemented a voice-controlled assistant using Python, incorporating natural language processing and various APIs. The assistant responds to voice commands, providing information from Wikipedia, performing calculations, opening web pages, and engaging in interactive activities like playing games. The project demonstrates proficiency in speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, API integration, and algorithmic logic. This code when provided with a working youtube API key, can search up youtube for the required topic and provide you the links and titles of the video within seconds.

Key Features:
Speech Recognition: Utilized the SpeechRecognition library to interpret voice commands and trigger corresponding actions.
API Integration: Integrated with external APIs such as Wikipedia, YouTube, and Google to fetch relevant data based on user queries.
Interactive Functionality: Implemented interactive features like a calculator, joke-teller, and a Rock-Paper-Scissors game to engage users.
Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions during speech recognition and API interactions.
User Interface: Provided both auditory and visual feedback to users through speech synthesis and console messages.
Extendibility: Designed with modular architecture, allowing easy addition of new features and enhancements.
Technologies Used:

Python
SpeechRecognition
pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
Google APIs (Wikipedia, YouTube)
Webbrowser (for opening web pages)
datetime (for time-related queries)
Exception Handling
Future Enhancements:

Addition of more advanced features such as weather forecast, email integration, and smart home device control.
Integration with machine learning algorithms for improved natural language understanding.
Implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction and feedback.
